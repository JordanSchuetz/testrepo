        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business EconomicsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm qualified for the positions of Executive Assistant, Communications Director, and Commissioner of Basic Needs because of the skills I've attained through my tenure in the non-profit Compost Culture, the Boy Scouts of America, the Habit Burger Grill, and my internship at Judson Studios. As the Chief Financial Officer of a newly formed non-profit, I have to develop strong communication skills in order to effectively work with the other officers to get the company off the ground and establish a strong base as we expanded our operations. In Boy Scouts, I was the Assistant Senior Patrol Leader of my troop, which meant I was second-in-command to the Senior Patrol Leader, the top leadership for youth. I learned how to assume the troop operations when they would be absent and took notes during weekly meetings that help remind them about certain details. In addition, in my current role as Assistant Scoutmaster, I help the adult Scoutmasters plan troop meetings and organize the scouts when they weren't doing what they were supposed to. As a Boy Scout and a volunteer at LoveLA, an organization that gives the homeless at Skid Row free food and drinks every week, I helped out at local soup kitchens, canned food drives, and Skid Row on a regular basis, and as a result, I learned about the needs of individuals, their dependency on these essentials, and how horribly their lives could go wrong without them. <br><br>

        Being the only non-Spanish speaking member at my local Habit meant I had to quickly find efficient ways of communicating if I wanted to stay afloat over constant waves of urgent commands and orders caused by influxes of customers daily. I quickly learned who were proficient English speakers and learned to use basic communication techniques to interact with the other team members, such as hand signals, nodding, and pointing.<br><br>

        My time as a Marketing intern at Judson Studios helped me learn more about how companies advertise their product and communicate with consumers. I learned about how they use strategies to talk as directly as possible to their following, such as waiting until the evening to post their social media updates because that's when they would have the most engagement. In addition, I honed my communication skills further for in-person conversations, by inserting a charismatic and energetic personality into my interactions with other people, so they would feel liked and want to listen to what I had to say easier. When the rest of the executive board of the non-profit organization I worked for planned the first annual gala a month before telling me, I was hurt because I was the Chief Financial Officer at that time and I wasn't informed at all about their plans. It also turned out that the gala would make us go over-budget for the year and I was forced to somehow fix a situation about an entire event I knew nothing about. So I met with the board and when I openly talked about how hurt I was about the situation, we were able to come agree for them to always keep me in the loop and I'll find a way to fix the overallocation of money for the event. Our agreement and solution was able to make our gala into a success, with more than a hundred attendees showing up to the event!For my Eagle Project, I was working under the director of the Children's gardens of my local botanical gardens: Huntington Gardens, Gretta. I knew her through working with her through my non-profit, Compost Culture. She needed someone to help build bee and insect hotels for the Children's Garden because they attract an abundance of pollinators to gardens. Beneficial insects support biodiversity, the foundation for the worldâ€™s ecological balance. An insect hotel in gardens will attract these beneficial insects, offering them a space where they can propagate and hunker down for the winter. The area I planed on placing these bee hotels is a learning garden aimed towards children to teach them about where their food comes from, because it consists of trees and plants that lack certain nutrients to survive. Encouraging biodiversity and pollinators in the garden helps to increase ecosystem productivity. Placing an insect hotel in the garden increases the chances that beneficial
insects will naturally visit the garden, and allows children to have a better learning experience as they learn about the importance of nature. But there was some miscommunication between Gretta and I. It turns out the gardens only need me to make bee hotels and insect hotels through drilling holes into around 10 natural, non-processed logs that will be strategically placed around the kidsâ€™ learning garden by figuring out the diameter the holes need to be, instead of making hotels with lumber and sticks. So we agreed to do both kinds of bee/insect hotels. The bee hotels will still be used to attract pollinators for the childrenâ€™s section at the Huntington Gardens, so underprivileged children have an engaging learning environment that teaches them about the benefits of healthy living. It would now have more of a beneficiary impact as both the previous plan and present plan have the same goals, but the present one is made with more natural materials which will be more persuasive in getting bees and insects to use the hotels.
